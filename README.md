# Password Generator Scrimba FrontEnd Module 3 - Essential Javascript Concepts 

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
````

See [Demo](https://shahs-password-generator.netlify.app/)


This password generator was actually made via React. You can visit the original repo which does not include the dark mode [here](https://github.com/Pharma2022/password-generator/). 

## Functionality
- First select if you want your passwords to include numbers, letters or symbols using the checkboxes, useEffect will update the state 
- On submission, the saved state will be used to generate random passwords. This is achieved through indexing the array which is saved in state. 
- You can copy the generated password 

##Frameworks/Libraries/Apis used
- React
- Navigator Clipboard API

## Stretch goals
- I have coded this using react, mainly because I wanted to integrate dark mode - it is possible to achieve this without react though
- I have also added copy functionality (which my vanilla js version has )

## Further Stretch Goals/General Improvements
- I would like to break my CSS into typography to make maintenance easier from a responsive design point of view
- It would be nice to connect firebase instead of having data.js
